# Resizable-Array / Dynamic Array, Python

#### Resizable arrays are mutable arrays which can grow and shrink according to our need. In resizable array, we don't need to declear size of array, as we did in static arrays.

This file consists of the following Functions/Methods:

1)####Insert_Value() Insert value simply appends the value/item to index 0 and so on.Initial lenght of array is 2, and when we push two elements at index 0 and 1, it will increase its size by multiplying its intital lenght with growth factor.So here the growth factor is 2. So if we append the third element, a new array of lenght 4 will be created in which above elements will be copy to its similar indexes, now we have to more spaces to push elements and that how Insert value function works.
